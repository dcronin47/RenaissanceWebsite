            <p>The field of architecture is home to some of the most notable artistic achievements from both the medieval and Renaissance periods. Here, I have foregone a direct comparison between a Gothic cathedral and a Renaissance one in favor of two buildings that served, and continue to serve, as auxiliary spaces of worship. The Pisa Baptistery, built separate from the main cathedral, was built specifically for performing the sacrament of baptism, while the Tempietto was designed by Bramante as a small center of worship on the supposed location of St. Peter’s martyrdom.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Pisa Baptistery represents the Pisan “dialect” of the Romanesque style, the dominant architectural style in Europe before the development of the Gothic style, drawing its name from its Roman-influenced columns and rounded arches. “Round” was not a common shape for buildings in the Middle Ages, which makes the Baptistery a unique example of applying Romanesque elements to irregular structures. It also draws on the style of the same round Greco-Roman temples that Bramate was inspired by in creating the Tempietto, which emblematizes the emphasis on classical ideas of harmony, unity, and balance. The key difference here is scale -- in the medieval period, often only buildings with a significant religious or secular purpose were designed with the care of a Gothic cathedral, and as a result, little non-monumental architecture survives from the period. On the other hand, the Tempietto represents a greater attention to detail -- a dedication to applying an architect’s eye to even very humble structures.

            <p>In contrast to built structures, which were totally of the real world, illustrations of architecture allowed artists to explore the abstract ideas of architectural design, without being weighed down with real-world concerns like construction and engineering. The buildings in the St. Albans Psalter are almost fantastical in their un-realism -- buildings are not simply structures, but are instead a colorful and diverse array of architectural elements -- domes, pillars, arches. The background serves to give the idea of a grand city without literally depicting it. In the foreground, the architectural elements serve a pictorial purposes as well, dividing the image between Mary and the assembled Apostles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Raphael’s <i>The Marriage of the Virgin</i> is similar, in that the architecture is not ostensibly the main focus of the painting, but serves to give the subjects a sense of place and convey certain ideas. The building in the background, similar to the Tempietto in style, serves to give the artist opportunity -- opportunity to illustrate his understanding of linear perspective; opportunity to pay homage to emerging trends in architecture; and even opportunity to play around with abstract ideas exemplified by Greco-Roman idealism. Harmony was the guiding principle of Renaissance art -- thus, what better symbol is there to suggest a harmonious union? The temple serves as a visual metaphor for the balance and stability associated with a happy marriage.
