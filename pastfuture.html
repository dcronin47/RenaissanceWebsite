            <p>One can learn a lot about a culture by the way it idealizes its past and where it came from. These works, a psalter (book of all 150 biblical psalms) from the court of 10th century art-loving emperor Constantine VII, and a famous fresco painted in the Vatican for art-loving pope Julius II, show how medieval and Renaissance artists dreamed of the past.
            </p><br>
            <p>In the Paris Psalter, as in the tradition, David composes the psalms with his harp, accompanied by the embodiment of melody, whereas Raphael’s fresco depicts a hypothetical meetup of the greatest minds of ancient Greece, with cameos by figures like the Greek general Alexander the Great and the Islamic medieval philosopher Averroes. Both depend on imaginative fantasy to establish the utopian nature of their subjects -- David sits in a lush landscape, surrounded by fauna, with blue sky and mountains behind him, while Raphael has arranged several prominent figures anachronistically to create this who’s who of influential philosophers. The primary difference, however, is the subject matter, and the attitudes towards their "pagan" forerunners. While later medieval philosophers would “re-discover” the works of Aristotle and attempt to syncretize some ancient Greek beliefs with contemporary Christian theology, the works of pagan philosophers tended to be downplayed in favor of Christian authors and thinkers. Thus, despite the Byzantines inheriting all of pagan Greece’s history, the workshop in this case chose to depict an Israelite king, whom they saw as more similar to them on account of their belief in the same God. Renaissance artists like Raphael had no such qualms, however, about lionizing the achievements of ancient pagan thinkers -- in the halls of the Vatican, no less. This change represents the church’s loss of a kind of artistic and cultural monopoly -- by the time late medieval philosophers had been engaging with Aristotle and other classical philosophers for centuries, the influence of those pagan thinkers’ ideas had gained a much greater respect in Europe, even within the church.

            <p>The Last Judgment -- the prophesied day on which the living and the dead will be eternally relegated to either heaven or hell -- has always been an opportunity for artists to pull out all the stops -- to use their imagination to try and create a glimpse into the cataclysmic final day on earth, the culmination of all past, present and future mortal life. These images are far too detailed to discuss in their entirety here, so I will focus on general themes and a few details.
            </p><br>
            <p>The tympanum -- the half-moon recess above the door of a church -- was often the site of medieval depictions of the Last Judgment, allowing the faithful to contemplate eternal salvation and damnation on their way into the house of worship. The tympanum at Sainte-Foy is packed with details -- imagine a medieval worshipper focusing on a different detail each Sunday they walked into the church.  It depicts Christ at the center, judging the living and the dead; to his right are the saved, gathered beneath the colonnade of heaven with famous saints. But to Christ’s left are the damned, and this is where the artist is at their most imaginative. In contrast to the orderly halls of heaven, the house of hell is chaotic, filled with terrifying demons that torment the unrepentant. The scene is a chaotic collage of visceral images, designed to remind sinners the terrors that awaited them should they continue in their ways.
            </p><br>
            <p>Michelangelo’s famous depiction of the same scene portrays a similar epic chaos. However, rather than placing such great emphasis on the unspeakable demons of hell, Michelangelo fills his depiction with famous figures, and offers a more contemplative and sympathetic image of the damned. Compare the nameless, indistinct torture victims in the tympanum with the lonely damned soul (around the middle of the bottom-right quadrant) in Michelangelo’s depiction, face half-covered by his hand, paralyzed by terror and disbelief at his fate. The medieval damned aren’t meant to be sympathized with; they’re meant as teaching tools -- “Don’t be like them.” On the other hand, the diverse damned souls of Michelangelo provoke contemplation on the nature of sin and damnation, and sympathy for the damned. No one envies the lonely man’s position, and the insight we get into his shock humanizes the day of judgment in a way that the medieval work does not.
