            <p>Here are two radically different portrayals of femininity. The Lady in the tapestry appears to enjoy a retreat from the world, served by a servant, in the company of tamed wild and domesticated animals. There is no single agreed-upon translation for the caption of the tapestry,  <i>“À Mon Seul Désir”</i>, but the literal translation, “to my sole desire”, along with the obedient animals and the woman’s evident wealth, suggests a level of independence and power. The association of unicorns and the color white with “purity” and virginity are on display, although it is difficult to “read” the image like a cohesive scene. What is suggested is a realm of feminine associations, far from the spaces dominated by men, like the church or the battlefield, over which this lady has power.
            </p><br>
            <p>Giorgione’s <i>Sleeping Venus</i> is the polar opposite to this symbol-centric approach to depicting femininity. Rather, Giorgione focuses almost entirely on depicting the unadorned, idealized female form. Pale, unblemished skin; a “soft” appearance (not too well-muscled); small, long-fingered hands; big eyes; thin eyebrows; red lips; round breasts; absence of body hair -- all of these attributes will shape European conceptions of feminine beauty for centuries, and still contribute heavily to beauty standards today. These depictions were, as you may expect, not symmetrical between the genders -- there were no female artists painting idealized “Sleeping Adonises” during the High Renaissance. Reclining female nudes like this were a way of exhibiting an image of sensual feminine beauty to a mostly-male audience, and it is difficult to imagine exhibiting a piece like this during the medieval period anywhere in Europe.
            </p><br>
            <p>*The influence of the Renaissance was not uniform across all of Europe, and the advent of new artistic ideals didn’t immediately end production of art in the medieval “style”. Thus, despite being produced contemporaneously with the High Renaissance in Italy, these French tapestries are usually considered to be examples of late medieval art.

            <p>Early in the development of Christianity, the Virgin Mary became the central female figure of religious devotion, representing love, mercy, motherhood in particular, and womanhood in general. The image of Mary with the baby Jesus embodied all these conceptions of ideal womanhood, and so the “Madonna with Child” became a very common subject of artistic depiction from very early on. However, how exactly Mary was depicted, and what aspects of her ideal womanhood were emphasized, would change over time and place.
            </p><br>
            <p>The French statue is an example of the depiction of Mary and the baby Jesus “enthroned”, representing a sense of majesty, grace, and power, while maintaining the humility of the subjects. The sculpture, once brightly painted, forgoes the physical details in favor of abstraction -- for example, both Mary and Jesus have similar faces -- instead trying to communicate more about Mary’s aspects of grace and humility. On the other hand, Raphael’s Madonna is a more human depiction, with a detailed, youthful face directed at the baby Jesus and the child John the Baptist. The greater emphasis on detail is also exemplified by the book held by Mary, and the titular bird shown by John to Jesus. The contrast between the works symbolizes the progression from medieval abstraction to Renaissance idealism, with artists making greater attempts to depict religious and historical figures in a more naturalistic and human way.
