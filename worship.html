            <p>The term “altarpiece” refers to any piece of art intended to be placed behind the altar at the back of a Christian church, and encompasses works in painting, sculpture, metalworking, enamel, and more. The Pala d’Oro at St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice depicts a geometric array of figures significant to Christian worship in gold and enamel, while Titian’s altarpiece, designed for the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, also in Venice, depicts a specific scene in the life of Mary, when she was whisked up to heaven at the end of her life.
            </p><br>
            <p>The two altarpieces take different avenues to create their respective churches’ devotional “focal point” -- the Pala d’Oro visually maps out the complexity of Christian belief through the many pious figures, both religious and secular, who helped Christianity to where it was in the 14th century. The detail, depicting Mary flanked by the Doge of Venice and the Byzantine Empress Irene, who ruled around 800 and zealously defended the production of traditional Christian art, offers a grounded, worldly view of worship that uses an ornate composition of precious metals, stones, and enamelwork to demonstrate the exchange of religious and artistic ideas with the Byzantine Empire. While most of the medieval works presented here are from western Europe, the Byzantine Empire was, at the same time, developing a complex artistic style that favored elaborate displays such as this. In contrast, Titian’s altarpiece is less ornate, instead using the simplicity of painting to create an otherworldly vision of Mary and heaven. Rather than distributing the altarpiece among disparate figures, Titian chooses a singular focus, so as to create a single compelling image. Notice also the difference between the static, statuesque Mary in the Pala d’Oro, contrasted with the dynamic, more human Mary of Titian’s altarpiece.

            <p>The “book of hours” was a personal devotional book, often lavishly illuminated, that illustrated the canonical hours -- the set times of the day at which monks would gather to chant and pray. With the rise of wealthy urbanites towards the end of the Middle Ages, such books became very popular among laypeople who wished to incorporate some elements of monastic practice and piety into their own lives. The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry is perhaps the most famous example of these works from the medieval period. The invention of the printing press made books more affordable, meaning that individually hand-crafted books of hours were rare by the time the Farnese Hours was produced. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Both pages present similar images, of Mary presenting the infant Jesus to adorers. Note, however, the difference in the shape of Mary. In the Very Rich Hours, Mary kneels, her body locked in a rigid upright posture, while in the Farnese Hours, she hunches over naturally to present the child to the onlooker. The medieval image gives the impression of several images arranged together -- the kneeling Mary, the splayed-out baby Jesus, and the kneeling old man, whereas the Renaissance image is of one continuous scene -- Mary leans over, holding the child, who grasps towards the unfamiliar figure, who offers him the a gift. In addition, the decision to frame this holy image with preening, chiseled male nudes would have been considered very odd, if not downright disrespectful, throughout most of the medieval period. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Both Titian’s <i>Assumption</i> and the Farnese Hours demonstrate the Renaissance’s experimentation with designing the scene as an inseparable whole, as opposed to creating composites of distinct figures.
