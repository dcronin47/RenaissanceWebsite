            <p>With these two images, we see two drastically different depictions of the male ruler and the male body. On the left is the robed figure of King Richard II of England, for whom this portable diptych was made, kneeling opposite the image of Mary with the baby Jesus (depicted on the right panel). Behind him, from left to right, are the English saints Edmund the Martyr and Edward the Confessor, as well as John the Baptist. Richard himself is almost androgynous, with much of his body hidden under his garments, except for his pale, slender fingers and boyish face. His saintly patrons behind him have the same slender build, their power and status mostly conveyed through their clothing and haloes. In the depiction, the men on the left panel demonstrate humble devotion to the holy mother and child -- a decision that unusually frames masculinity in terms of pious humility and service above all.
            </p><br>
            <p>The image of Moses on the right cannot be more different than that of Richard. Intimidating, muscular, and wisened, he is the opposite of the slender, humble young king in the diptych. Crucially, even in his old age, Moses’ physical prowess hasn’t dulled. Michelangelo chooses to frame Moses’ masculinity in terms of a physical strength that makes him fit to lead his people. Comparing the muscular Moses to the four men depicted in the Wilton Diptych, who all share a similar body type, demonstrates the Renaissance’s burgeoning interest in exploring physical ideals of masculinity.

            <p>The association of prowess in battle with masculinity is one that has existed almost as long as depictions of warfare have existed. A single battle could turn the tide of history, and victory in those battles was seen as depending on the quality of the men who fought them -- the side whose men were braver, stronger, and more disciplined would carry the day. The Bayeux Tapestry, commissioned to commemorate the Norman conquest of England in 1066, features many battle scenes. In the midst of them is then-Duke William fighting bravely among his loyal men. In this scene, accompanied by the Latin caption “HIC EST WILLEL... DUX” -- “Here is Duke William”, William lifts his helmet to indicate to his men that he is still with them. On the right is Carpaccio’s portrait of a young anonymous knight, posing in his armor amid a complex natural setting.
            </p><br>
            <p>The first contrast is that of the stature of the subjects -- now-King William is depicted almost the same as all his other men, fighting just as hard as the common soldier to bring victory. His masculinity is not ostentatious, but instead evident from his courageous fighting on the front lines, as well as the loyalty and devotion of the men who follow him. On the other hand, Carpaccio’s nameless knight is dressed to project a manly image -- polished armor, sword at the ready, and with a prominent codpiece. We have a soon-to-be-king demonstrating his masculinity by fighting anonymously among his fellow men, and an anonymous man attempting to appear masculine by bedecking himself with the trappings of manliness far from a battlefield.  Not all the wealthy urbanites who commissioned portraits of themselves and their families during the Renaissance had the kind of battlefield experience and prowess that William demonstrated -- thus, the period saw the development a kind of “performative” masculinity through art, through “prop” symbols -- the armor, the sword, the codpiece -- that could be used to suggest virility in any subject.
