            <p>Here, we see European artists’ depictions of two foreign rulers world-renowned for their wealth and power -- Mansa Musa I, the early-14th-century emperor of the west African Mali Empire, and Sultan Mehmed (or Mehmet) II “the Conqueror”, who ruled the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century and was best known in Europe for defeating the remnants of the Byzantine Empire and capturing Constantinople in 1453. Both artists include symbols of royalty -- the crown and scepter for Musa, and the triple crowns for Mehmed -- so that European viewers can contextualize these images. Both artists also represent the source of each ruler’s power with objects. Musa holds a gold coin, alluding to the vast wealth he amassed through his control of west African gold mines, and Mehmed is depicted behind an example of the complex and luxurious Turkish embroidery that so many Europeans associated with the Ottomans. The primary difference, however, is that Mehmed’s portrait was created at the behest of the sultan himself, while Musa’s depiction was made by a Majorcan artist almost fifty years after his death -- thus, Mehmed takes center stage in his own portrait, while Musa is depicted almost as a geographical curiosity in the context of the Catalan Atlas.

            <p>Leaders throughout history have understood the propagandistic value of art -- talented artists can make clear the distinction between the “hero” and the “villain”; the “wise” and the “foolish”. While these two artworks are drastically different, they both represent efforts to cast a culture’s outsiders as misguided in the face of the truth embodied by the dominant culture’s beliefs.
            </p><br>
            <p>“Ecclesia et Synagoga” was a popular artistic motif throughout the Middle Ages, throughout which prejudice against Jews was prevalent in much of Christian Europe. Central to this prejudice was the idea that Jews were “blind” to the truth, having not accepted Jesus as the Messiah, thus putting them in conflict with the Christians who accepted him. This idea was depicted literally in this motif as a blindfold over the eyes of the woman representing the synagogue, while the woman representing the church wears a crown and nobly carries the symbols of her devotion. The prevalence of this motif helped to instill this prejudice throughout Christendom, leading to a general understanding of Jews as people who chose spiritual “blindness”. Carpaccio’s depiction of St. George is a slightly less hostile characterization of the Other, with the European Christian George effortlessly slaying the dragon, to the amazement of the “Oriental” onlookers. While the treatment of non-Europeans and non-Christians varied widely across Europe (Carpaccio’s hometown Venice was especially diverse through the medieval and Renaissance periods), this painting represents the Other in a slightly more sympathetic way, as people who simply need to be shown the truth of Christianity’s favor, as opposed to the decision of the Notre-Dame sculptors to depict the Other as deliberately ignorant.
