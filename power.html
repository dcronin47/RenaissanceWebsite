            <p>In the late Middle Ages, the landscape of power changed. The two traditional wielders of power -- the nobility and the clergy -- found themselves competing with upstart urbanites, made wealthy by trade without direct assistance from the king or the bishop. These old powers didn’t fade, but they had to seriously take into consideration the interests of these new urban elites, for mercenary groups could be bought, making wealthy cities potential military powers as well. Northern Italy exemplified this trend, with various republican city-states grappling for control over lucrative trade routes at the dawn of the Renaissance.

            <p>The depiction of King Louis IX of France, later canonized as St. Louis, represents the old nature of medieval European power. Louis holds the orb and scepter and wears a golden crown, the traditional regalia of the Christian king as defender of the realm. The lavish nature of the depiction itself -- the gold background and colorful robes -- emphasize the worthiness of Louis to wield this spiritual and secular authority. Vasari’s depiction of Lorenzo de’Medici represents the transformed nature of power of the urban elite. Lorenzo is less ostentatious -- there is no gold leaf, or kingly artifacts. While finely dressed with fur cuffs, Lorenzo wears an outfit that would be familiar to wealthy merchants, not kings. While rulers like Lorenzo still emphasized God’s favor of their virtuous rule, the signs and symbols of the old ways make way for the new nature of power in Vasari’s portrait.

            <p>Both medieval and Renaissance artists also sought to legitimize their rule by invoking the past, and comparing their own contemporary rulers to those of history and myth. The Winchester Roundtable, constructed around 1300 and decorated with its current design a few centuries later, invokes the Round Table of the legendary King Arthur. Based on a possibly-real Romano-British king who defended Britain against invading non-Christians, the character and lore of King Arthur would be thoroughly embellished throughout the medieval period, representing an idealized, chivalric, pious order of nobility that defended Christian Britain. It was no wonder, then, that British kings were often fans of the stories of Arthur and his court, as they allowed themselves to portray their own rule as the righteous continuation of Arthur’s royal and sacred duties.
            </p><br>
            <p>During the Renaissance, artists and leaders also looked to the legendary past for propagandistic purposes, with a crucial difference. While the medieval rulers often portrayed themselves as continuing a noble tradition, Renaissance artists overlooked the near past almost entirely in their search for symbolic traditions to inherit, instead arguing that they were restoring the Roman majesty that had been lost for a thousand years. This bust of Cosimo I de’Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in the guise of a Roman emperor, was an attempt by Cellini to claim the glory of the distant past for his patron. The claims of this nature made during the Renaissance were stronger than those made during the medieval period, as Renaissance artists depicted their patrons not simply as continuing a tradition, but as resurrecting the glory of Rome after a millennium of neglect.
