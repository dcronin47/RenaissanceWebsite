            <p>These two depictions of marriage represent one hypothetical and one real couple -- the Codex Manasse is a book of German poetry, illuminated with scenes of love and courtly life. The Renaissance portrait is one commissioned for a real couple by the groom’s wealthy family, intended to commemorate the event. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Marriage became artistically linked with a variety of symbols, which are visible in both depictions. The woman in the Codex Manasse holds a small dog, commonly associated with fidelity, while Faustina wears a pearl necklace, typically seen as a symbol of submission to one’s husband. Cupid unites the couple with a yoke lined with laurel leaves, symbolizing the faithful bonds of love and marriage. Power is also represented in both images, as the man in the Codex Manasse holds a sword, presumably to protect his wife, while Marsilio Cassotti prepares to gift his new wife with an expensive ring, referencing different conceptions of power in the medieval and Renaissance periods. In addition, the medieval scene includes the image of a family crest, referencing much of Europe’s interest in heraldry during the late Middle Ages, while Lotto’s painting uses sumptuous textiles to portray the wealth of the groom. Closely observe the visual balance of the images -- in the medieval page, the spouses’ hands meet in the middle as their bodies both curve towards each other, while in the Renaissance painting, the man takes up more space in the center, while his wife leans into his upright form, making the gender power imbalance more clear.

            <p>Along with the Renaissance’s greater interest in the human body came a greater artistic focus on sexual intimacy. During the medieval period, such depictions were far rarer, due in part to who was commissioning the art. The Catholic Church held great sway over much of Europe, and most artistic work produced -- illuminated manuscripts, cathedrals and their ornamentations, and even private devotional materials in the later Middle Ages -- was commissioned either by the church or by nobles who maintained close relationships with it. The rise of urban elites in Northern Italy and the Netherlands, especially, led to artwork that was far more “secular” than anything that came before. Thus, the Renaissance brought a greater artistic focus on sex, not necessarily tethered to any moralistic implications.
            </p><br>
            <p>Consider the half-concealed seductress and the fully-clothed Lancelot in comparison to Romano’s two completely nude lovers, concealed only by strategically-placed shocks of fabric. The medieval image has heavy moral implications, of the honorable knight trying to preserve his virtue in the face of immoral temptation. He pulls away from her, his hands outstretched as if to put more distance between them, meeting her smile with a look of deep discomfort. It would be an oversimplification to claim that the medieval attitude towards sex was one of universal disgust, but the image does demonstrate a medieval suspicion towards sexual intimacy, indicating that one’s “virtue” was something that both men and women were expected to guard. On the other hand, Romano’s lovers are not tied down by any such hesitancy -- they embrace without a care, their hands draped around each other, their faces almost touching. In contrast to Lancelot’s wariness towards sex, the two lovers are so engrossed in each other that they seem not to have noticed the creeping observer peering out from behind the door.
