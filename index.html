        <h2 class="subtitle is-4">A project by Daniel Cronin</h2>
        <p class="content">As the Middle Ages waned and the Renaissance bloomed in Europe, nowhere was the cultural transformation as evident as it was in art, as painters, sculptors, and architects experimented with innovative yet classically-inspired approaches to aesthetics. In this mini-exhibition, I have paired similar works -- one from the medieval period and one from the Renaissance -- so that you can see how perspectives on common artistic themes changed with the advent of the Renaissance. The site is divided into themes of Architecture, Masculinity, Femininity, Worship, Worldly Power, the Other, Intimacy, and the Past and Future.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="content">While the Middle Ages is often defined as the period in Europe beginning in the fifth century and continuing until the beginning of the Renaissance, most medieval works presented here are drawn from the late Middle Ages (13th-15th centuries). These works are diverse in origin and medium, representing the broad range of artistic styles and influences in medieval Europe. In contrast, the Renaissance works presented here are mostly painting and sculpture derived from the Italian High Renaissance period of the early 16th century.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="content">I hope you enjoy exploring this cultural transformation through the paintings, sculpture, manuscripts, and more presented here.</p>
